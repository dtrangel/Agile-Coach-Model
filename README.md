# Agile Coaching Model

This repository describes an Agile Coaching Engagement Model. This model was developed at the end of 3Q 2018 as a proposal to formalize and build up the Agile Coach role within Expedia. Efforts to formalize were stalled in 4Q 2018, but the effort is being adjusted and revitalized in 2019 via a community of supporting invdividuals and teams.

The idea behind this approach is to build a community of practioners willing to contribute to the ongoing development and coaching of Lean-Agile across an organization. It is a collaborative space, where all practitioners can come together to create a reference for how to build up their own Agile Coaching model within their organization, and teach others how to improve theirs.

You should start by reading through this README file. If you agree with the fundamental concept and structure and wish to apply this within your team or organization, you can join our effort by sending a pull request to this README file, and adding your name to the list of practitioners.

If you like most of what you see, but not all, or wish to emphasize different things about your Agile Coaching approach - but you agree on the same fundamental concept - you should fork this repository, remove the names of practitioners from this file, and build your very own Agile Coaching Model. All we ask is that you please give attribution of your model as a derivative of Agile Coaching Engagement Model.

# Agile Coach Engagement Overview
Organizations that do not have a consistent model or role definition for day-to-day best practice when it comes to development management. Some teams are better than others at managing the value stream by leveraging agile practices and having clear role definitions. Teams not adopting and practicing lean-agile principles and practices are at greater risk of being overburdened and not adding continuous value. Signals of inefficient or ineffective development practices include:

1. Too much demand; overextended backlog
2. Too much work in progress
3. Too many interrupts
4. Lack of visibility and transparency
5. Lack of relevant metrics
6. No consistent roadmap; constant adjustments to plan
7. Burnout
8. Lack of inspiration or innovation
9. No clear roles and responsibilities
10. No working agreement
11. No customer reviews and stakeholder communications

The Agile Coach Engagement Model describes how an Agile Coach can help teams improve their overall development processes and value contribution via workshops, hands-on work, and continuous improvement/follow up. The Agile Coach Model is meant to be a short term engagement, with ongoing follow up and training to enable teams to be self-organizing and autonomous.

## Candidates
Any team looking to improve their overall process and impact. Typically a team recognizes the need to improve in one or many areas when it comes to managing their workflow and consistently delivering value. 

### Use Case 1
A team is comprised of 7 development engineers at varying levels of experience. There is an Engineering Manager (EM) and Technical Product Manager (TPM) on the team as well. The EM is responsible for ensuring the team has a clear technical vision, solution path, and quality standards. The TPM is responsible while working closely with the EM, for the product vision, roadmap, and customer/stakeholder engagement. The team does not have a dedicated Scrum Master for day-to-day process management and optimizing the delivery capabilities of the team.

### Use Case 2
A new team is being formed to work on a problem or opportunity. The team needs to come together to start work, which typically starts with an inception. The inception needs to be all-inclusive in that it clearly defines the problem or opportunity, scope of work, customers and stakeholder, measurements of success, Minimum Viable Product, working agreements, and development method. 

## Proposed Agile Coach Engagement
An Agile Coach engagement should lead to positive outcomes. While there are many, uncontrollable factors that could impede the success of the engagement and ultimately the team, there will be clear outputs from the engagement signaling a relevant change in how the team plans, delivers and sustains their applications and services. The Agile Coach will identify, recommend, and attempt to implement changes to address risk factors as much as possible.

> Development Management Foundations (Currently In Development) will be designed to introduce a simplified work model to help teams visualize and adopt a sustainable workflow. The Agile Coach can leverage this work model to help teams understand the various elements of a sustainable workflow and the best practices associated with the stages of the work model:

> **Team Chartering & Alignment - Discover & Define - Construct, Deliver, & Sustain***

## Assessment

Every Agile Coach engagement will start with an assessment phase. The assessment will help the Agile Coach determine the health of the team and identify areas of focus. The assessment will, at a minimum, include an interview or series of interviews with the team as a whole or individually that will allow the coach to get an understanding of the current processes, pain points, expectations, and objectives of the team. An assessment model may also be used similar to [Spotify’s Squad Health Check Model](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/16/squad-health-check-model/). It will be the determination of the Agile Coach as to the assessment method and model to use, based on guidance and vetted material from the Agile Coach Community.

The assessment will help determine the scope of work and focus areas for the engagement. For the purposes of this initial proposal and proof of concept (POC), the engagement model outline all areas of focus. Future models will take into account shorter engagements or workshops designed for specific areas of focus, such as estimating principles and practices.

## Lean-Agile Fundamentals
It is recommended each engagement start with some level of exposure into the principles and concepts of Lean-Agile while preparing teams for the journey ahead. Topics may include:

* The Agile Mindset and the what it means to “Be Agile vs. Doing Agile”
* How we work and types of work
* Plan-driven vs. value-driven
* Lean-Agile values and principles
* Relative Estimation
* Planning principles and concepts
* Managing WIP
* Agile roles and responsibilities
* Communications and team dynamics

> Team Development Management Foundations Workshop, currently in development, is a condensed version of the Development Management Foundations Workshop. This workshop should help Agile Coaches provide a consistent, high-level overview of the concepts and principles of Lean-Agile while preparing teams for the Agile Coaching Engagement.

## Chartering and Alignment
The Agile Coach will work with the team to ensure alignment at the team, stakeholder, and customer level. The vision, mission, and objectives of the team are paramount to delivering continuous value. Additionally, the team should have a very clear understanding of working agreements, norms, requirements, and measures of success for both their product and team health.

Depending on the team and assessment insights, some of these may require more or less focus during the engagement.

### Outcomes of Alignment

1. Product/project alignment
  * Problem or opportunity
  * Vision
  * Scope
  * Key stakeholders
  * Customers
  * Objectives and Measures of success
2. Team alignment
* Roles and responsibilities
* Capabilities and gaps
* Team working agreement
* Customer and stakeholder working agreement
* Delivery alignment
3. Plan-Driven vs. Value-Driven
* Solution approach
* Ceremonies and cadence (Flow, Feedback, Experimentation)
* Definition of Done

## Discover and Define
Discover and define will incorporate a set of practices and exercises to help teams identify and break down individual work items as they relate to the broader objectives. Teams will have a visible representation of the prioritized work they need to complete, how to measure impact, and where to identify value-add.

### Outcomes of Discovery and Define
1. Backlog
2. Feature/function categorization and estimation
3. Prioritized backlog
4. Performance metrics
5. Priority roadmap

## Construct Deliver and Sustain
Once a team has identified their priority roadmap and backlog, the Agile Coach will embed and work with the team to implement and iterate on an effective workflow and development practice. This part of the engagement encompasses many different aspects and essentially places the Agile Coach in a position to help the team become self-directed. In this role, the Agile Coach will facilitate and support the team in their development processes, customer/stakeholder engagement, validated learning, operational readiness, support structures, team dynamics, and overall adoption of Lean-Agile concepts and principles. The Agile Coach will help the team understand why they are implementing specific Agile principles and practices and how these improve the team’s engagement and performance.

### Outcomes of Construct, Deliver, and Sustain
1. Planning and execution
* Release planning
* Iteration planning
* Standups
* Retrospectives
* WIP Management
2. Engagement and Feedback
* Demonstrations
* Stakeholder engagement
* Customer/Ops Reviews
* Release notes
* Feature requests and management
* Retrospectives (Team only)
3. Operational Readiness
* DevOps Maturity Assessment
* Issue management
* Support queues
* Development and productivity metrics

# Agile Coach Role and Responsibilities
Formal, industry-wide definitions for Agile Coach and expected outcomes vary. It’s essential organizations come to a common understanding of the role, requirements, expectations, values, and guiding principles. 

## Agile Coach Defined
[Agile Coaching - Lessons from the Trenches](https://www.infoq.com/articles/agile-coaching-lessons) by Gene Gendel and Erin Perry is a comprehensive description of the Agile Coach role and the variations of engagement based on their experience. We will leverage this article to help craft a better understanding of the Agile Coach role.

### Coach vs. Trainer
The Agile Coach mission is to empower teams to become better at managing the development lifecycle and value stream while enabling them to be self-organized and self-managed. In this context, the Agile Coach is not training a team, but is guiding them to realize potential and demonstrate effectiveness. A coach is very clearly different than a trainer, and Agile Coaches should feel comfortable with this distinction.

However, this does not suggest an Agile Coach does not have to train a team or team member through the course of the engagement. Agile Coaches may have to provide training for various reasons. The primary takeaway is that the Agile Coach, first and foremost, values and aspires to retain a coaching position throughout the engagement.

| Agile Coach | Agile Trainer |
|:---|:---|
| Primary goal of coaching is to guide the team toward self-improvement through observation and guidance. | Primary goal of training is to impart knowledge. |
| Coaching is usually much longer in duration. It is not strictly time-boxed. Coaching engagements may be shorter or longer, depending on the progression and comfort level of the team. The coaching agenda is rarely fixed. Instead, it is responsive to the current needs of the team. Experienced coaches frequently use situational/opportunistic coaching to flex their style as needed. | Training is usually much shorter in duration: time-box is fixed and so is, typically, agenda. |
| Coaching does not stress hierarchical relationship between Coach and team. The success of coaching is frequently dependent on Coach’s ability to establish rapport and trust with the team. | Training relies on hierarchical relationship, with Trainer being in a position of authority over the Trainees. |
 | A Coach is not expected to be an expert in any one skill or subject area, but instead have broad experience in coaching as a skill. | A trainer is expected to be a subject matter expert in a given domain. |
| A Coach’s primary goal is not to provide Coachee with final answers and complete solutions but rather enable Coachees derive their own answers and solutions by steering discussions and thinking. | Training is largely directive, providing Trainees with ready answers and solutions. |
